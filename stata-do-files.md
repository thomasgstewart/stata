## Reproducible Research

From [Matt Shotwell's Reproducible Research Tutorial](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/ReproducibleResearchTutorial)

>Reproducible research (RR) is the practice of conducting and presenting research in such a way that others, and yourself can later re-implement your research strategy without ambiguity. In the context of statistical collaboration, this means that you or someone else can easily reproduce all of your actions relating to data management and data analysis, and reach the same result. Since the statistical collaborators work is mostly done using computer tools, reproducible research means documenting all of the tools and procedures (applications, data storage formats, programs/scripts) that were used.

## DO FILE

While not a sophisticated as the reproducible research tools of other statistical software programs, STATA does offer the DO File.  All the command for your analysis are stored in a single file so that the output can be reproduced.

>**KEY POINT:** Every step and every command of your analysis should be recorded into a .do file.

Here are some dry, but informative YouTube videos I found on the .do file by Googling the term.
